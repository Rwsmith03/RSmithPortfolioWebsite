A simple webpage meant to show off my portfolio, showing my work experience, projects, and a bit more about me.
This is mainly meant to show off a little of my web design skills, primarily focusing on web development. 
It includes some extra pages to to learn a little more about me if you would like too along with
a contact form and some contact information.
